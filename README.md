# MobileEats

[MobileEats](https://mobileeats.app) is a web application that allows mobile food vendors to relay business information such as current location, menu items, and pricing to a user audience, who has the ability to view and review the vendors' profiles.

This is a Codeup capstone project created using Java, SpringBoot, MySQL, Javascript, CSS, Filestack api, Mapbox api, Thymleaf, Jquery, and Bootstrap.

  <li>Sign up for Filestack and use your api key into the "application.properties" file</li>
  <li>Run the application in your environment and it should be hosted locally on "localhost:8080"</li>
</ul>
